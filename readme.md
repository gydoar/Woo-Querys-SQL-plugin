# Woo Querys SQL ðŸ›’

This is part of the second round interview for Sr. Web Developer - [Supreme Optimization company](https://www.supremeopti.com/).

Basically a plugin to demonstrate SQL queries with WooCommerce in 10 exercises, I decided to put each exercise in a custom shortcode to be reuse in WordPress when you have WooCommerce activate.

## Exercises

> [!NOTE]
> Using WordPress with WooCommerce installed and Demo data complete the following using just MySQL. 


After install the plugin as usually, use the following shortcodes in posts, pages, etc... to show the query, don't forget to be sure you are already installed WooCommerce plugin.
1. Retrieve a list of all products.  
**Shortcode** `[list_products]`

2. Retrieve the details of a specific product by its ID.  
**Shortcode** `[product_details]`

3. Retrieve the total number of products.  
**Shortcode** `[product_count]`

4. Retrieve the average price of all products.  
**Shortcode** `[average_price]`

5. Retrieve the products sorted by their price in descending order.  
**Shortcode** `[list_products_desc]`

6. Update the price of a specific product.  
**Shortcode** `[update_price]`

7. Delete a product from the database.  
**Shortcode** `[delete_product]`

8. Retrieve the list of customers who have placed orders.  
**Shortcode** `[list_customers]`

9. Retrieve the total revenue generated by a specific customer.  
**Shortcode** `[customer_revenue]`

10. Retrieve the customer who has placed the highest total order value.  
**Shortcode** `[highest_customer]`
